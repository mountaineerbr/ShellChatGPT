Acording to the lastest e-mail in the thread (the first message) below, please 
 lets try and figure out a nice mention of the Novita AI service proving Llama3.1 as requested. Also, do you think Leo is being a little demanding? They only offered 20bucks afterall, and it is not like I will use all the 20 bucks any soon!








-----------------------


Hey Jamil,

 

Many thanks to your release!

 

For model recommendation, I will suggest Llama 3.1 to you and your users. Although it is namely the "best" model from us, which may not that fit your expectation, I believe Llama 3.1 is model with the best balance of price and performance. Besides, for uncensored models, we provide sao10k/l3-70b-euryale-v2.1 and cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b. If possible, I wish that you can let your users know we are providing Llama 3.1 models. A hashtag added on your Github page or addtional mention will be perfect.

 

Well, personally Llama 3.1 is the best.

 

Thank you again for leaving my name on your Github page. I will be more than happy if you correct Novita AI before my name.

 

Cheer for our collab!

 

Leo

This also means very limited development with Novita endpoint at my side, but as I said, the script is already compatible with Novita AI API and I shall mention Novita AI in the script project README.md page, so the user can set it manually, or, hopefully in the next few days, pass the `--novita` command line option to the script on invocation, which should make the integration work a little better than if I did not do any tweaks in the script for Novita AI API at all...

-----------------






Currently, Novita AI integration is mentioned as below in my readme.md page.






### Novita AI

Novita AI offers a range of LLM models at exceptional value!

Create an API key as per the
[Quick Start Guide](https://novita.ai/docs/get-started/quickstart.html)
and export your key as `$NOVITA_API_KEY` to your environment.

Next, run the script such as `chatgpt.sh --novita -cc`.

Check the [model list web page](https://novita.ai/model-api/product/llm-api)
and the [price of each model tokens](https://novita.ai/model-api/pricing).

To list all available models, run `chatgpt.sh --novita -l`. Optionally set a model name with with `option -l` to dump model details.

Some models work with the `/completions` endpoint, while others
work with the `/chat/completions` endpoint, so the script _does not set the endpoint automatically_! Check model details and web pages to understand their capabilities, and then either run the script with `option -c` (**text completions**) or `options -cc` (**chat completions**).
